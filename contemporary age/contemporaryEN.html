                        The accession to the throne of Elizabeth II(1952) made some anticipate a new 'Elizabethan Era', owing to the growing prosperity of the country
                        and the general well-being of the population. In the general euphoria there was a revival of nationalism and even of imprerialism.
                        Dissolution soon came, though.

                                The post-war years witnessed the progressive dissolution of the British Empire. After the concession of independence
                                to India and Pakistan(1947) almost all the former colonies became self-governing communities within the association formed by the Statue of
                                Westminster(1931), known as the Commonwealth.

                        The Conservative government (1959-1963) with the intention to counteract the unsteady economic growth started negotiations on entry into EEC(European Economic Community).
                        Britain first joined EFTA(European Free Trade Association) and then, in 1961, formally applied for membership of the Common Market.

                                However, the French
                        leader, Charles De Gaulle, in 1963 vetoed British entry into the EEC. De Gaulle, who never believed in a politically united Europe, was resolved ot build up
                        a Europe of the homelands that would become a third superpower, between the USA and the USSR, and was suspicious of Britain's close bonds with Washington.

                            Only the resignation of De Gaulle, in 1969, opened up the possibility of British entry. Britain finnaly entered EEC in January 1973. However, while subscribing
                        to many EU policies, the UK chose to maintain its own currency instead of the euro.

                        The post-way for years, the newly elected Labour government set about creating the Welfare State. This was a system of national insurance crated to protect everyone from
                        'the cradle to the grave'. The expression 'Welfare State' essentially means that totality of plans and services through which central Government together with local 
                        authorities assumes a major responsibility for dealing with all the different types of social problems.

                                This was first and foremost designed to maintain a high level of
                       employment through the nationalisation of major industries. Another air of the Welfare State was to provide efficient public services, particularly education, health and transport.
                       To pay for social security and services the government relied on taxation.
                            </p>

                            Up until 1979, succesive governments dealt with the problem of how to maintain a tolerable 
                       distribution of wealth and services, and with a series of government acts reconised the need for the true equality between sexes. The <i>Equal Pay Act</i>(1970) and the
                       <i>Sex Discrimination Act</i>(1975) made discriminatory treatment of women in the workplace illegal. Besides, the <i>Race Realtions Act</i> of 1976 tried to halt
                       the racist tendencies emerging in an ingreasingly multiethnic society.

                        In 1979, the British electorate voted in a Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990), the first woman to be a leader of a political party in Britain
                       and the first woman Prime Minister.

                       she called the 'culture of dependancy'.

                       both Cnservative and New Labour governments have undermined the Welfare State. The Conservatives aggresively, New Labour less so.
