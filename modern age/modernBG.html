                        In the last decades of the 19th century, England's foreign policy had been one of 'splendid isolation'. Europe was then divided between France
                        and Russia on one side, Germany, Austria and Italy on the other.

                                After the turn of the century, however, Britain became concerned about the
                        expansion of the German Empire. In 1904, Britain and France, both frightened by Germany, signed a treaty of friendship. In 1907, this agreement became the
                        <i>Triple Entente</i>, when France's ally, Russia, joined.

                            disillusionment that followed the conflict.

                        involved in the conflict, as well as the colonies of the British Empire. The Great War was a conflict of unparalleled destruction, in which six million died 
                        and twenty five million were maimed.

                        and in the same time the League of Nations was founded in Geneva with the aim of keeping peace and controlling difficult political situations all over the world.
