                        In the last decades of the 19th century, England's foreign policy had been one of 'splendid isolation'. Europe was then divided between France
                        and Russia on one side, Germany, Austria and Italy on the other.

                                After the turn of the century, however, Britain became concerned about the
                        expansion of the German Empire. In 1904, Britain and France, both frightened by Germany, signed a treaty of friendship. In 1907, this agreement became the
                        <i>Triple Entente</i>, when France's ally, Russia, joined.

                            his son George V(1910-1936) came to the throne. His reign is often associated with the horrors of the First World War (1914-1918) and the sense of
                            disillusionment that followed the conflict.

                        World War I, was a global war that began on 28 July 1914 and ended on 11 November 1918. 
                        It involved much of Europe, as well as Russia, the United States and Turkey, and was also fought in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest conflicts in history, an estimated 9 million were killed in combat, while over 5 million civilians died from occupation, bombardment, hunger or disease.
                         Genocides and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic spread by the movement of combatants during the war caused many millions of additional deaths worldwide.

                                Tensions in the Balkans came to a head on 28 June 1914 following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian heir, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb. 
                                Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia and the interlocking alliances involved the Powers in a series of diplomatic exchanges known as the July Crisis.   </p>

                            In November, the Ottoman Empire, Germany and Austria formed the Central Powers, while in April 1915, Italy joined Britain, France, Russia and Serbia as the Allied Powers.

                                    The human cost of the First World War was horrendous. More than 16 million people, both military and civilian, died in the war. An entire generation of young men was wiped away. In 1919, the year after the war was over in France, there were 15 women for every man between the ages of 18 and 30. It is tragic to consider all of the lost potential, all of the writers, artists, teachers, inventors and leaders that were killed in ‘the war to end all wars.’

                                shattered with the Great Depression in 1929. The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States.
                                 The timing of the Great Depression varied around the world; in most countries, it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s.
                                 The Great Depression had devastating effects in both rich and poor countries. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade fell by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 23% and in some countries rose as high as 33%.

                            But although the impact of the First World War was hugely destructive it also produced many new developments in medicine, warfare, politics and social attitudes. The First World War changed the nature of warfare. Technology became an essential element in the art of war with airplanes, submarines, tanks all playing important new roles.
                            Modern surgery was born in the First World War, where civil and military hospitals acted as theatres of experimental medical intervention.

                        The Commonwealth of Nations, generally known simply as the Commonwealth,[3] is a political association of 54 member states, almost all of which are former territories of the British Empire.
                         The chief institutions of the organisation are the Commonwealth Secretariat, which focuses on intergovernmental aspects, and the Commonwealth Foundation, which focuses on non-governmental relations amongst member states.

                                The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories. It was originally created as the British Commonwealth of Nations through the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference, and formalised by the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster in 1931.
                                 The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949, which modernised the community and established the member states as "free and equal".

                            Many Commonwealth nations possess traditions and customs that are elements of a shared Commonwealth culture. Examples include common sports such as cricket and rugby, driving on the left, the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy, common law, widespread use of the English language, designation of English as an official language, military and naval ranks, and the use of British rather than American spelling conventions (see English in the Commonwealth of Nations).

                        Dictatorships emerged during the 1920s and 1930s. Totalitarian governments found fertile ground for growth in Russia, Italy, Germany and other countries.
                        In Russia, Communism came to power in the revolution of November 1917. In Italy, Mussolini founded the Fascist party in 1919.

                        government was replaced by a coalition headed by Winston Churchill(1874-1965). His inspired leadership united the people if Britain against Nazi Germany
                        and its allies.
